            Spicy Thai Red Curry Chicken and Rice
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
                <li>1 small bunch scallions, sliced and divided</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
                <li>1 jalapeno, diced</li>
                <li>14 oz can coconut milk (unsweetened)</li>
                <li>2 tbsp thai red curry paste</li>
                <li>2 tbsp fish sauce</li>
                <li>2 1/2 tbsp dark brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 1/2 pound chicken breast, cut into 1 inch cubes</li>
                <li>1 tbsp lime juice</li>
                <li>1/4 cup cilantro</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oil over medium-low heat in a large nonstick pan. Add the light scallions, garlic, and jalape√±o and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Do not brown.</li>
                <li>Add the coconut milk, red curry paste, fish sauce, and brown sugar and whisk together. Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat and simmer until thickened, a few minutes. Add the chicken and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally to promote even cooking, until the chicken is cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. (Do not let the sauce boil; the idea is to cook the chicken gently so that it's tender.) Stir in the lime juice, dark scallion greens, and cilantro. Taste and adjust seasoning with more lime, if necessary. Serve with jasmine rice.</li>
